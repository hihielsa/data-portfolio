# Data Portfolio

This repository contains selected data science projects from my MSDS program and personal work.  
Each project demonstrates different skills in **data preprocessing, machine learning, neural networks, and visualization**.

## ðŸ“Œ Projects
### 1. Analysis of Chicago Public Schools Performance (Dec 2024)
- Performed exploratory analysis and visualization of educational data.  
- Generated **analysis notebook** with charts and narrative insights.  
- Focused on clear **storytelling for decision-makers**.  
- ðŸ“‚ Folder: `Chang_Executive_Summary_Final.ipynb` + `images/`

### 2. Loan Default & Loss Prediction (Aug 2025)
- Built predictive models for **loan default** (classification) and **loss given default (LGD)** (regression).  
- Applied data cleaning, one-hot encoding, missing-value imputation, and capping techniques.  
- Compared **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and TensorFlow Neural Networks**.  
- **Results:** Gradient Boosting achieved best AUC (0.90) and lowest RMSE (~2.5k, 13% error).  
- ðŸ“‚ Folder: `Loan_Default_Loss_Prediction.ipynb` + HTML report
